# EPD
A WPF and ASP.NET application made as a school project.
It's a fairly old project, so there are some imperfections.

In order to make it work, you need to go into \EvidencePracovniDobyOfficial\API in terminal, and type: dotnet ef database update
You also need Microsoft SQL Server installed on your computer (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)
